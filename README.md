# dynamic-routing-using-Djisktra

This is a Simulation for Dynamic Routing implemented in JAVA using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm

It involves:

--> Initializing routers from the text file inputted by the user

--> Simulating the process of generating routing table for each router in a given network

--> Computing the optimal path with least cost between any two specific routers

--> Updating and revising a routing tables based on change in the cost between the router and one of its directly connected neighbors

The application provides a Console Interface for the user to interact with the simulator.


Simulation:

Open up the Terminal or Command prompt:
$ cd src
$ javac MainEngine.java
$ java MainEngine

-OR-
$ cd src
$ java -jar MainEngine.jar
